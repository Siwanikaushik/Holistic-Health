        <div class="about">Mental Health<br/></div><br><br>
        <div class="quote">"Mental illness is nothing to be shamed of, but stigma and bias shame us all"<br/></div>

        <div class="defi">Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize 
            their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value 
            and is integral to our well-being.<br/>At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may 
            combine to protect or undermine mental health. <br/><br>
       </div>

        <div class="imptotalk">The fear of judgment silences many from discussing mental health openly. This silence perpetuates stigma and prevents individuals from seeking support. Encouraging open conversations can break down barriers, fostering understanding and empathy. Creating safe spaces where people feel heard and accepted is essential for promoting mental health awareness and providing the support individuals need to thrive.</div><br>

        <div class="global">In 2019, 970 million people globally were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression the most common.Globally, mental disorders account for 1 in 6 years lived with disability. 
            Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly, and many more do over their lifetimes. It’s estimated that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men will experience major depression in their lives.
            Other conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are less common but still have a large impact on people’s lives.</div><br><br>
  
        
        
      <br> <div class="content"> These pointers highlight the importance of self-awareness, social support, professional assistance,

        <div class="about2">4. Reducing Stigma:</div><br> <div class="content2">Stigma around mental health can prevent individuals from seeking help. Raising awareness, promoting open conversations, and challenging stereotypes can contribute to reducing stigma and creating a more supportive environment for those facing mental health challenges.</div><br/>

        <div class="about2">5. Healthy Coping Strategies:</div><br> <div class="content2">Developing healthy ways to cope with stress and adversity is essential. This may include practicing mindfulness, engaging in creative activities, journaling, spending time in nature, and avoiding unhealthy coping mechanisms like substance abuse.</div><br/>

        <div class="about2">6. Balanced Lifestyle:</div><br> <div class="content2">Maintaining a balanced lifestyle that includes time for work, leisure, social interactions, and self-care is vital. Striking a balance between different aspects of life can prevent burnout and enhance overall mental well-being.</div><br/>

        <div class="about2">8. Limiting Screen Time:</div><br> <div class="content2">Excessive screen time, especially on social media, can negatively impact mental health.
